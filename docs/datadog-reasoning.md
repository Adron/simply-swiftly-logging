# Datadog Event Stream and Logging Implementation

## Overview
This document explains the implementation of event streaming and logging in the simply-swifty-logging application, detailing how it mimics real-world application events and their tracking in Datadog.

## Event Stream Architecture

### 1. Event Types
The application implements several types of events to simulate real-world scenarios:

```swift
private let eventMessages = [
    "Working.",
    "Operational deviation.",
    "Shifted.",
    "Work Completed - %@"
]
```

These events represent different types of application activities:
- Regular status updates
- Operational changes
- State transitions
- Task completions

### 2. Event Generation
Events are generated through two mechanisms:

#### Heartbeat Events
```swift
heartbeatTimer = Timer.scheduledTimer(withTimeInterval: 5.0, repeats: true) { _ in
    let timestamp = Date().formatted(date: .omitted, time: .standard)
    let message = "Tick - [\(timestamp)]"
    messages.append(message)
    loggingService.logMessage(message, level: .debug)
}
```
- Regular interval events (every 5 seconds)
- Simulates system health checks
- Logged at DEBUG level

#### Random Events
```swift
func scheduleNextEvent() {
    eventTimer?.invalidate()
    eventTimer = Timer.scheduledTimer(withTimeInterval: Double.random(in: 1...8), repeats: false) { _ in
        generateEvent()
        scheduleNextEvent()
    }
}
```
- Random interval events (1-8 seconds)
- Simulates user interactions
- Logged at INFO level

## Logging Implementation

### 1. Log Levels
The application implements a comprehensive logging system:

```swift
enum LogLevel: String {
    case debug
    case info
    case notice
    case warning
    case error
    case critical
}
```

### 2. Log Attributes
Each log entry includes contextual information:

```swift
let attributes: [String: any Encodable] = [
    "source": "ui_scroll_view",
    "timestamp": Date().timeIntervalSince1970
]
```

### 3. Log Categories
- **UI Events**: User interface interactions
- **System Events**: Application state changes
- **Error Events**: Exception and error handling
- **Performance Events**: Timing and performance metrics

## RUM (Real User Monitoring) Implementation

### 1. View Tracking
```swift
struct RUMViewModifier: ViewModifier {
    let name: String
    @StateObject private var loggingService = DatadogLoggingService.shared
    
    func body(content: Content) -> some View {
        content
            .onAppear {
                let rum = RUMMonitor.shared()
                rum.startView(
                    key: name,
                    name: name,
                    attributes: [:] as [String: any Encodable]
                )
            }
            .onDisappear {
                let rum = RUMMonitor.shared()
                rum.stopView(key: name)
            }
    }
}
```

### 2. Action Tracking
```swift
rum.addAction(
    type: .custom,
    name: "message_displayed",
    attributes: [
        "message": message,
        "level": level.rawValue
    ] as [String: any Encodable]
)
```

### 3. Error Tracking
```swift
rum.addError(
    error: error,
    source: .custom,
    attributes: [
        "context": context
    ] as [String: any Encodable]
)
```

## Differences Between Logging and RUM

### 1. Purpose
- **Logging**: Detailed application events and debugging
- **RUM**: User experience and performance monitoring

### 2. Data Collection
- **Logging**: Structured application events
- **RUM**: User interactions and view lifecycle

### 3. Use Cases
- **Logging**: Debugging and troubleshooting
- **RUM**: Performance optimization and user experience

## Crash Analytics

### 1. Implementation
The application uses Datadog's crash reporting:

```swift
Datadog.initialize(
    with: Datadog.Configuration(
        clientToken: Config.Datadog.clientToken,
        env: Config.Datadog.environment,
        site: .us5,
        service: Config.Datadog.service
    ),
    trackingConsent: .granted
)
```

### 2. Crash Data
- Stack traces
- Device information
- Application state
- User context

## Event Flow

### 1. Event Generation
1. Timer triggers event
2. Event data is created
3. Event is logged
4. RUM event is created
5. UI is updated

### 2. Data Flow
1. Application generates event
2. Event is logged to Datadog
3. RUM data is collected
4. Data is processed by Datadog
5. Results are available in dashboard

## Best Practices

### 1. Event Logging
- Use appropriate log levels
- Include relevant context
- Maintain consistent format
- Avoid sensitive data

### 2. RUM Tracking
- Track important user interactions
- Monitor view lifecycle
- Track performance metrics
- Handle errors properly

### 3. Crash Reporting
- Include relevant context
- Handle sensitive data
- Maintain proper stack traces
- Track user impact

## Monitoring and Analysis

### 1. Log Analysis
- Event patterns
- Error rates
- Performance metrics
- User behavior

### 2. RUM Analysis
- User experience
- Performance issues
- Error rates
- Usage patterns

### 3. Crash Analysis
- Crash patterns
- User impact
- Root causes
- Fix verification

## Conclusion
The simply-swifty-logging application demonstrates a comprehensive approach to event logging and monitoring using Datadog. By implementing both logging and RUM tracking, it provides a complete picture of application behavior and user experience.
